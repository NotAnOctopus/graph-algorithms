# graph-algorithms

a bunch of common algorithms on graphs that i can copy paste into wherever i need them.

- bfs
- dfs
- connected components
- topological sort
- prim
- kruskal
- dijkstra
- bellman ford
- floyd warshall

might add other ones if they somehow end up being a big important part of my life for some apparent reason also, if ice hockey goalkeepers were really fat, they could cover the entire goal and make it impossible for the other team to score
